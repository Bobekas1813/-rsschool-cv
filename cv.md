##### Write a function that when given a URL as a string, parses out just the domain name and returns it as a string. For example:

* url = 'http://github.com/carbonfive/raygun' -> domain name = "github"
* url = "http://www.zombie-bites.com"         -> domain name = "zombie-bites"
* url = "https://www.cnet.com"                -> domain name = cnet"
```
   function domainName(url){
    let arr;
    let str;
    let art;

   if(url.includes('www')){
     arr = url.split('.');
     return arr[1];
   }
    
    if(url.includes('http')){
      arr = url.split('//');
     str = arr.join('.');
     art = str.split('.');
    return art[1];
    }
  
    arr = url.split('.');
    return arr[0]; 
  }
  ```
